		Q: Do you prefer traveling by airplane or car?
		</p>
	<br><br>
		<p1>
		A: "They have different purposes, so I can't say if I prefer one over<br>
		the other. On one hand, cars are great for everyday convenience,<br> but planes can transport you 
		across 
		the world. If I were given the choice <br>of taking a car ride or a plane ride 
		to the same destination (say, across <br> the country), I'd choose the plane ride 
		because of the speed."
