		Q: What was your favorite place that you have traveled to?

	<br><br>
		<p1>
		A: My favorite place that I've traveled to would probably be Japan - 
		there's <br> a wealth of culture and good food there,
		and it lines up well with my interests <br> in games
		and anime. I definitely own a lot of Japanese stationery. 
		In particular, <br> I tend to buy a lot of Tombow Air Mono erasers because they're my favorite.
