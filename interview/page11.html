		Q: How has traveling affected your perception on asethetics?
		</p>
	<br><br>
		<p1>
		A: "Traveling has affected my aesthetics by exposing me to many different
			<br> 
		aesthetics. I've been able to see many different kinds of architecture, see
			<br>
		different folk arts, and view different means of advertising, and those all
			<br>
		come together in what I find pleasing,"
